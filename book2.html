<h2>The Four Types of Human Behavior and How to Effectively Communicate with Each in Business (and in Life)</h2>
<p>Erikson will help you understand yourself better, hone communication and social skills,
     handle conflict with confidence, improve dynamics with your boss and team, and get the best out 
     of the people you deal with and manage. He also shares simple tricks on body language, improving
      written communication, advice on when to back away or when to push on, and when to speak up or
       shut up. Packed with ‘aha!’ and ‘oh no!’ moments, Surrounded by Idiots will help you understand 
       and communicate with those around you, even people you currently think are beyond all comprehension. 
       And with a bit of luck you can also be confident that the idiot out there isn’t you!</p>
