<h2>The phenomenal international bestseller - that will change the way you make decisions'A lifetime's worth of wisdom' Steven D. Levitt</h2>
<h3>“There have been many good books on human rationality and irrationality, but only one masterpiece. That masterpiece is Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow . . . This is one of the greatest and most engaging collections of insights into the human mind I have read.”</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>The book's main thesis is that of a dichotomy between two modes of thought: "System 1" is fast, instinctive and emotional;
"System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates rational and non-rational motivations or triggers associated with each type of thinking process, 
    and how they complement each other, starting with Kahneman's own research on loss aversion. From framing choices to people's tendency to replace a difficult question with one
     which is easy to answer, the book summarizes several decades of research to suggest that people have too much confidence in human judgement. This data is summarized from decades
      of Kahneman's research, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky. It covers different phases of his career: his early work concerning cognitive biases, his work on prospect 
      theory and happiness, and with the Israel Defense Forces.</p> 
<p>The integrity of many of the priming studies cited in the book have been called into question in the midst of the psychological replication crisis, although the results of Kahneman's 
    own studies have been replicated. The book was a New York Times bestseller and won the 2012 winner of the National Academies Communication Award for best creative work that helps the 
    public understanding of topics in behavioral science, engineering and medicine.</p>
